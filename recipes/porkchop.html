    <h1>Pork Chops with Apple Cider Glaze</h1>
        <img src="../images/porkchop" alt="It's a porkchop."> 
        <p>Pork chops with a glossy apple cider glaze is really easy, and while there's no starch or extra butter involved, it reduces quickly to a thick, rich, sweet-tart apple syrup. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 (6 ounce) boneless center-cut pork chops </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar </li>
            <li>2 cups apple cider </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced rosemary </li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season pork chops with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops in the hot oil mixture until browned on both sides and pork is slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pan from the heat; transfer pork chops to a plate.</li>
            <li>Stir garlic into the pan and place over medium-high heat; cook and stir for 30 seconds. Pour in vinegar and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add apple cider and Dijon mustard, bring mixture to a boil, and cook until sauce is reduced and thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rosemary and red pepper flakes; season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Return pork chops to the pan to warm slightly, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
